Class Component

- They are ES6 classes.
- Similar to a functional component, a class component can also optionally receive props
  as input and return HTML.
- A class component can also maintain a private internal state;
  > meaning: it can maintain some info which is private to that component and use info
            to describe the UI.


Functional vs. Class components
-> Functional
  - simple functions receiving props & returning a declaration
  - use functional components as much as possible
  - Advantages:
    - Absence of 'this' keyword [is in class component]
    - solution w/o using state
    - mainly responsible for the UI
    - tend to be w/o any complicated logic
  - Functional components are also called: stateless/ dumb/ presentational components

-> Class
  - more feature rich
  - can maintain their own private data known as: state
  - can contain complicated UI logic
  - provides life-cycle hooks
  - Class components are also called: stateful/ smart/ container components
